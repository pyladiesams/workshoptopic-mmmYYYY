# { WORKSHOP NAME } 
### Presentation: [{ YOUR PRESENTATION NAME }](workshop/presentation_template.pdf)

## Workshop description
Describe why your topic is important and what you want to share with your audience

## Requirements
* PyLadies Amsterdam uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
* Google account if you want to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
 
## Usage
### with uv
Run the following code:
```bash
git clone <github-url-of-workshop-repo>
cd <name-of-repo>

# create and activate venv, install dependencies
uv sync
```
### with Google Colab
1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. In the top left corner select "File" &#8594; "Open Notebook"
3. Under "GitHub", enter the URL of the repo of this workshop
4. Select one of the notebooks within the repo.
5. At the top of the notebook, add a Code cell and run the following code:
```bash
!git clone <github-url-of-workshop-repo>
%cd <name-of-repo>
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### for a workshop giver
To get started, open the `pyproject.toml` file and set the required Python version. The pre-selected version 3.8 is generally a safe choice for most use cases.

After you have specified the Python version, you can create a virtual environment with `uv venv` and add packages with `uv add <package>`. Before the workshop, you can generate a requirements.txt file, which is needed e.g. for running code in Google Colab, by running `uv export > requirements.txt`.

## Appendix
### Pre-Commit Hooks

To ensure our code looks beautiful, PyLadies uses pre-commit hooks. You can enable them by running `pre-commit install`. You may have to install `pre-commit` first, using `uv sync`, `uv pip install pre-commit` or `pip install pre-commit`.

Happy Coding :)
